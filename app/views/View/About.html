			<h1 class="center">What is LoL Cruncher?</h1>
			<p>
				LoL Cruncher is an online service that provides long-term statistics for
				your summoner in League of Legends, as a total and as rates/averages.
				The goal of this is for people to see their statistics such as the amount
				of wards the place per game, or the amount of minions they farm per 10 minutes
				to get a better insight on how they play, and can compare these numbers with
				their friends and other fellow players.
			</p>
			<h1 class="center">How does this differ from other services?</h1>
			<p>
				Other services only provide detailed statistics for your
				most recent games, or only for ranked games. There is no other service
				like LoL Cruncher which actively monitors without user action and records detailed statistics for each
				champion and for normal game modes/queues from the games you play. Apart from having
				to search for your summoner name once to register it, you don't
				need to come back regularily to "refresh" or "update" your profile as it refreshes and updates
				by itself.
			</p>
			<h1 class="center">What are you planning to do with this?</h1>
			<p>
				If enough people use this, I would also like to add features to allow people to compare their statistics to
				others, and even publish the data for people to analyze and make infographics. However, this was made
				in my free time and I'm only 16 and still have highschool to go through. Thus I may not be able
				to spend that much time working on it, however someone else can fork it and improve it if they
				would like, as the source code is
				<a href="https://github.com/1lann/LoL-Cruncher" target="_blank">available here</a>.
				<br><br>
				A list of planned features is also
